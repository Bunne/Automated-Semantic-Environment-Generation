# ASEG : Automated Semantic Environment Generation
Decription: ASEG is the software developed for two chapters of the dissertation "Automated Extraction of Action Semantics for the Parameterized Action Representation using English Knowledge Bases".
## Requirements: [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/),`
In addition, ASEG requires the following python libraries:
1. [Natural Language Toolkit] (https://nltk.org/)
1. [Numpy] (https://numpy.org)
1. [Spacy] (https://spacy.io)
We also make use of a mapping from WordNet to FrameNet. There are several online as well as several techniques to do so. Please be aware that you will need a text file to do so.
## USAGE
Please see the wiki examples for how to use this software.
